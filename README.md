# Panel_dyadic_logit

This is a data and code repository for the article "A Vacancy Chain Model of Local Managersâ€™ Career Advancement" (Hongtao Yi & Catherine Chen), to
be published in Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory. The article investigates the the career trajectories of U.S. city managers 
national-level angle and examines city-level attributes that drive city managers' career move choices. 

In this repository, we provide the R code we used to organize city level attributes into a strcuture suitable for dyadic logit regression, scale 
variables, and estimate panel dyadic logit models and rare event logit models. The details can be found in "dyadic_logit_code".

We also include city attributes data for 767 cities in our dataset. The data are collected from the 1990, 2000, 2010 census, CQ Press, and other sources. 
The files are: "1990_all_attri_i.csv", "2000_all_attri_i.csv", and "2000_all_attri_i.csv". Below is the list of variables included in the csv files. Please see 
the "dyadic_logit_code" for explanations of the variable subscript "_i" shown in the csv files. 

*All variables indicate city-level data
- city_ID: FIPS code 
- pop: population 
- unemp: unemployment rate
- pcinc: per capita income 
- div: racial diversity index
- dem: vote share for Democratic presidential candiate
- lat: latitude 
- longt: longtitude

Further details of data sources, coding, and modeling can be found in our paper.
